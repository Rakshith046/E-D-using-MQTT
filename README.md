# üîí Encrption and Decryption using MQTT
### About the project:
‚ñ† Encryption is the process through which data is encoded so that it remains hidden from or inaccessible to unauthorized users and Decryption is a process of converting encoded/encrypted data in a form that is readable and understood by a human or a computer.
<br>

‚ñ† This Encryption and Decryption is carried out through MQTT server in this project.
<br>

‚ñ† MQTT is a publish-and-subscribe protocol, meaning that instead of communicating with a server, client devices and applications publish and subscribe to topics handled by a broker.

## Code for Encryption and Decryption using Python:
   
   ### In the file project.py:
   ``` python
from random import randint, seed

message= input("Enter the text:")
variable = ""
variable1 = ""
#FOR ENCRYPTION:
s=int(input("Set the SEED:"))
seed(s)
for i in message:
    key= randint(1,10)
    print(key,end=" ")
    asc_val= ord(i)
    xor_= asc_val ^ key
    encrypted =chr(xor_)
    variable += encrypted
print()
print("After Encrypting:",variable, end="")
print()

#FOR DECRYPTION:
n= int(input("Enter the seed:"))
seed(n)
for i in variable:
    key= randint(1,10)
    print(key,end=" ")
    asc = ord(i)
    xor = asc ^ key
    decrypt= chr(xor)
    variable1 += decrypt
print()
print("After Decrypting:",variable1, end="")
print()

```

 ‚óè This code encrypts and decrypts the text or message entered by user:
 
   ‚á® After executing this code, it ask's the user to enter the messege which must be encrypted.
   <br>
   ‚á® It say's to set the [SEED](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/random-seed-in-python/#:~:text=Seed%20function%20is%20used%20to,number%20generated%20by%20the%20generator). This seed is used to generate different keys for encryption. It is shown in below pic: 
   <br>
   
   ‚á® After entering the message and seed, the code generates the different keys for each characters in the message. The ascii value of each character is found and exored with each key that provides the encrypted form of message.
   <br>
   ‚á® To decrypt the encrypted message, it asks for the SEED that has been set for encrypt the message. Now it proceeds in reverse process, it finds the ascii value of each character of encrypted message and the SEED provides the same keys and exored, finally gets the plain text entered by the user.
