# ðŸ”’ Encrption and Decryption using MQTT
### About the project:
    â—¼ Encryption is the process through which data is encoded so that it remains hidden from or inaccessible to unauthorized users and, Decryption is a process of converting encoded/encrypted data in a form that is readable and understood by a human or a computer.
    â–  This encryption and decryption is set up using MQTT in this project.
    â–  MQTT is a publish-and-subscribe protocol, meaning that instead of communicating with a server, client devices and applications publish and subscribe to topics handled by a broker.
